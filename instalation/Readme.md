# Install PosgresSQL

Now we need to install dependencies for PostgreSQL to work with Django with this command:
```
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev
```

Now that you have done this, install PostgreSQL like so:
```
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

PostgreSQL is now installed on your machine and ready to roll.
